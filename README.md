# Morse-translator
<h2>Run in Windows!</h2>
<p>
The Morse code translator works in Win32 operating sistems only, because it makes use of the 'windows.h' library.</br>
<b>If you want to see it in action just run the .exe file and enter your message.</b>
 </p>
 <p>The following characters are supported for translation:</br>
  <ul>
    <li>Letters A-Z (both uppercase and lowercase)</li>
    <li>Numbers 0-9</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Note: Entering an invalid character will throw an error message, but the remaining valid characters will continue to be translated.
